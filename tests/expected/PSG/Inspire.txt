SUMMARY OF REPORT: This was an attended overnight HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE STIMULATOR TITRATION polysomnogram performed at Aspen Sleep Centers monitoring the following physiologic parameters: EEG 4 channels, EOG 2 channels, airflow at the nose and mouth, chin EMG, tibialis EMG, chest and abdominal movements, EKG with surface electrodes, pulse oximetry, and body position. The patient was prepared for the study without difficulty. The waveforms were reviewed and were technically adequate.
Lights out occurred at 10:00 PM.
Study ended at 4:00 AM.

IMPRESSIONS:
1. [] Obstructive sleep apnea [] significant oxygen desaturations. These events were improved with [].
[]. [] Sleep efficiency

[]. Snoring
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Based on the findings in this HGNS titration study, the patient may benefit from [].
[]. Central sleep apnea may be associated with cardiopulmonary disorders such as CHF, asthma/COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, neurologic disorders such as Chiari malformation, other CNS pathology, medication/substance effects such as with opioid use, etc. Clinical correlation with further evaluation/management as indicated is recommended.
[]. Aside from significant obstructive sleep apnea, causes of nocturnal oxygen desaturations may include various disorders such as pulmonary parenchymal and/or vascular disease, cardiac disease, thoracic cage anomalies, neuromuscular disease, medication/substance effects, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, etc. Clinical correlation with further evaluation/management as indicated is recommended.
[]. The patient should be advised to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if not fully alert.
[]. Under medical supervision, regular exercise as tolerated and weight reduction is encouraged.
COMMENT: This patient has been seen in consultation by [] and will be contacted with the results of the study.
