HISTORY: []
Medications: []
Epworth Sleepiness Scale: []
STOPBANG: []
BMI: []
RESULTS: This was an unattended overnight portable home sleep study performed by Aspen Sleep Centers using an Alice NightOne Type III device. The following physiologic parameters were recorded: Airflow at the nose, chest and abdominal movements, and pulse oximetry. The waveforms were reviewed and were technically adequate. Hypopneas were scored using 4% oxygen desaturation.
Recording: Started: ${start}, Ended: ${end}
1. DURATION OF EVALUATION: ${trt}
2. RESPIRATORY EVENTS: AHI: ${ahi}/hr
Apnea Index: ${ai}/hr, Hypopnea Index: ${hi}/hr
The patient's respiratory events were primarily obstructive.
3. OXYGEN SATURATION: Average: ${ox_avg}%, Minimum: ${ox_min}%
Oxygen Desaturation Index: ${odi} Events per hour
Duration of study with oxygen saturation <89%: ${od_duration}
4. HEART RATE: Average: ${pulse_avg} BPM
5. SNORING EVENTS: ${snores}
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Abnormal portable sleep study consistent with [] Obstructive Sleep Apnea [] significant oxygen desaturations.
[]. Excessive daytime sleepiness with high ESS score.
[]. Class [] Obesity with BMI: []
[]. Snoring
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The patient has obstructive sleep apnea and may benefit from a trial of auto CPAP provided by a DME company with a pressure range from [] centimeters H2O with EPR 3 cm H2O and with further pressure adjustments to be made on a clinical basis.
Alternatively, the patient may be a candidate for oral appliance therapy provided by a dentist.
[]. Due to the significant duration and extent of oxygen desaturations identified on this home sleep study, recommend obtaining a nocturnal oximetry following auto CPAP acclimatization or oral appliance therapy titration.
[]. The patient should be advised to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if not fully alert.
[]. Under medical supervision, regular exercise as tolerated and weight reduction is encouraged. For patient's with a BMI 35 or greater, bariatric/nutritional referral may be appropriate.
COMMENT: This patient has been seen in consultation by [] and will be contacted with the results of the study.
