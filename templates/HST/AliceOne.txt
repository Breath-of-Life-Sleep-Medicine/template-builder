POLYSOMNOGRAM SUMMARY REPORT: HOME SLEEP STUDY
Date of study: ${date}
Referring provider: ${referring}
Sleep provider: ${provider}
Interpreting Sleep Physician: Mary-Alice Jaeger MD
HISTORY: []
Medications: []
Epworth Sleepiness Scale: []
STOPBANG: []
BMI: []
RESULTS: This was an unattended overnight portable home sleep study performed by Aspen Sleep Centers using an Alice NightOne Type III device. The following physiologic parameters were recorded: Airflow at the nose, chest and abdominal movements, and pulse oximetry. The waveforms were reviewed and were technically adequate. Hypopneas were scored using 4% oxygen desaturation.
Recording: Started: [], Ended: []
1. DURATION OF EVALUATION: []
2. RESPIRATORY EVENTS: AHI: []/hr
Apnea Index: []/hr, Hypopnea Index: []/hr
The patient's respiratory events were primarily obstructive.
3. OXYGEN SATURATION: Average: []%, Minimum: []%
Oxygen Desaturation Index: [] Events per hour
Duration of study with oxygen saturation <89%: []
4. HEART RATE: Minimum: [] BPM, Average: [] BPM, Maximum: [] BPM
5. SNORING EVENTS: []
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Abnormal portable sleep study consistent with [] Obstructive Sleep Apnea [] significant oxygen desaturations.
[]. Excessive daytime sleepiness with high ESS score.
[]. Class [] Obesity with BMI: []
[]. Snoring
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The patient has obstructive sleep apnea and may benefit from a trial of auto CPAP provided by a DME company with a pressure range from [] centimeters H2O with EPR 3 cm H2O and with further pressure adjustments to be made on a clinical basis.
Alternatively, the patient may be a candidate for oral appliance therapy provided by a dentist.
[]. Due to the significant duration and extent of oxygen desaturations identified on this home sleep study, recommend obtaining a nocturnal oximetry following auto CPAP acclimatization or oral appliance therapy titration.
[]. The patient should be advised to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if not fully alert.
[]. Under medical supervision, regular exercise as tolerated and weight reduction is encouraged. For patient's with a BMI 35 or greater, bariatric/nutritional referral may be appropriate.
COMMENT: This patient has been seen in consultation by [] and will be contacted with the results of the study.
