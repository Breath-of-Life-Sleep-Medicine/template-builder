SUMMARY OF REPORT: This was an attended overnight DIAGNOSTIC polysomnogram performed at Aspen Sleep Centers monitoring the following physiologic parameters: EEG 4 channels, EOG 2 channels, airflow at the nose and mouth, chin EMG, tibialis EMG, chest and abdominal movements, EKG with surface electrodes, pulse oximetry, and body position. The patient was prepared for the study without difficulty. The waveforms were reviewed and were technically adequate.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The patient has sleep apnea and would likely benefit from a trial of auto CPAP provided by a DME company. This may be done with initiating auto CPAP [] centimeters H2O with EPR 3 cm H2O and with an appropriately fitted mask and heated humidifier. Further pressure adjustments may be made on a clinical basis.
Alternatively, the patient may benefit from oral appliance therapy provided by a dentist.
[]. Consider other causes of subjective daytime fatigue/sleepiness/insomnia, such as poor sleep hygiene, insufficient sleep, irregular sleep-wake pattern/circadian rhythm disorder, medication/substance effects, mood disorders, medical disorders, primary hypersomnias, etc. Clinical correlation with further evaluation/management as indicated is recommended.
[]. If the patient is interested in further management for primary snoring, then therapeutic options as clinically appropriate may include optimization of nasal breathing(saline rinses, nasal dilators, nasal lubricants, nasal breathing practice, nasal steroids, allergy medications, Singulair, ENT referral), sleep/airway dental/orthodontic referral for further evaluation and management with arch expansion with fixed or removable appliances, anti snore devices, weight loss, physical exercise, etc. Clinical correlation with further evaluation/management as indicated is recommended.
[]. Central sleep apnea may be associated with obstructive sleep apnea, cardiopulmonary disorders such as CHF, asthma/COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, neurologic disorders such as Chiari malformation, other CNS pathology, medication/substance effects such as with opioid use, etc.. Clinical correlation with further evaluation/management as indicated is recommended.
[]. Aside from significant obstructive sleep apnea, causes of nocturnal oxygen desaturations may include various disorders such as pulmonary parenchymal and/or vascular disease, cardiac disease, thoracic cage anomalies, neuromuscular disease, medication/substance effects, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, etc.. Clinical correlation with further evaluation/management as indicated is recommended.
[]. The patient should be advised to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if not fully alert.
[]. Under medical supervision, regular exercise as tolerated and weight reduction is encouraged. For patient's with a BMI 35 or greater, bariatric/nutritional evaluation may be appropriate.
