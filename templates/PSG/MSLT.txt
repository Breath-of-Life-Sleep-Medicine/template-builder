AVERAGE SLEEP LATENCY: []
SLEEP ONSET REM PERIODS: []
IMPRESSIONS:
1. [] Average sleep onset latency of [] which is [] with hypersomnia.
2. [] sleep onset REM periods.
3. Diagnostic polysomnography performed the night prior to this study showed no evidence of clinically significant obstructive sleep apnea and found a REM sleep latency of [].
4. This MSLT data [] suggestive of a diagnosis of narcolepsy.
The differential diagnosis for hypersomnia without obstructive sleep apnea and without the presence of 2 or more sleep onset REM periods on the MSLT proceeding PSG includes idiopathic hypersomnia, insufficient sleep syndrome, hypersomnolence due to a medical disorder, hypersomnolence due to a psychiatric disorder such as depression, circadian rhythm disorders, RLS/PLMD, neuro degenerative disorders, genetic disorders, psychogenic sleepiness, and hypersomnolence due to medication or substance use.
Of note, the diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia according to ICSD-3-TR:
All of the following:
1. Daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into drowsiness or sleep that occurred for at least 3 months
2. Cataplexy not present
3. PSG and MSLT findings not supportive of a diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1 or 2
4. Presence of at least 1 of the following:
-MSLT with mean sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 minutes
-total 24 hours sleep time greater than/equal to 660 minutes(typically 12-14 hours) as measured by either 24 hour polysomnography or by wrist actigraphy in association with a sleep log average over at least 7 days with unrestricted sleep
-insufficient sleep syndrome is ruled out by failure of sleepiness to improve after an adequate trial of increased nocturnal time in bed preferably documented on at least 1 week of actigraphy
-no better explanation for signs and symptoms is provided by another sleep disorder, circadian rhythm sleep-awake disorder, medical disorder, mental disorder, or medication/substance use or withdrawal.
PLAN:
1. The patient should be advised to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if not fully alert.
2. Use of sleep diaries, actigraphy, review of medication/substance use, and other medical concerns may be helpful to evaluate hypersomnia further.
3. Recommend patient follow up with their sleep provider or primary care provider as indicated.
This patient has been seen in consultation with [] and will be advised of the study results.
